# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

## Attendance

**From most recent data (2023-2025) for scheduled workshops, virtual and hybrid workshops have the highest attendance.**  A few topics have higher attendance than others.  A short 2023 analysis showed longer (presumably more detailed) event descriptions got higher attendance relative to title/date only short descriptions. 

Otherwise, workshops requested by someone either standalone or in a course have the highest attendances.
