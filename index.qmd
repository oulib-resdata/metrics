# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

## Attendance

For workshops that we as librarians independently schedule,
  - virtual and hybrid workshops have the highest attendance in the last two calendar years (2023-2025)
  - a few topics have higher attendance than others reglardless of format
  - more precise and detailed event descriptions seem to get higher attendance than title only descriptions.

Otherwise, workshops requested by someone either standalone (such as by a department or research group) or within a course have the highest attendances.
