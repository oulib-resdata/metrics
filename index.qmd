# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

## Attendance

For workshops that we as librarians independently schedule,

  - for most topics, virtual and hybrid workshops have higher attendance (6.4) than in-person (4.3) in the last two calendar years (2023-2025)

  - a few topics have higher attendance (15) than others regardless of format

  - more detailed event descriptions seem to get higher attendance than title only descriptions


Otherwise, workshops requested by someone either standalone (such as by a department or research group) or within a course have the highest attendances.
