# Summary

This OSF storage contains assessment and registration data for OU Libraries research workshops.


#Output and figures

This folder contains individual figures created.  These are not complete reports and do not contain any context.

# Raw Data 

Stored in OSF Storage as it contains user names.  Download separately from OSF and place in /raw_data relatively to metrics repository directory.
Contains its own readme with details, but one folder each for pre-workshop (registration) data and post-workshop survey data.  Surveys are not 100% of attendance.  In 2020 we switched from qualtrics to libcal and have not finished creating scripts to merge those data.

# Reports GO HERE FOR READY MADE SLIDES AND DATA

This section contains polished reports suitable for Senior Management Team.

# Scripts

Copntains R and Rmd files for conducting analysis.

# Additional files
- Create_Marketing_Report.R will render a .Rmd file from scripts that creates a word document in Reports.
- survey_link_and_more_resources_slide.pptx is a slide instructors can use that links to the post-workshop survey.
- word_styles.docx is a template used by the .Rmd files in scripts to format .docx as desired.
- workshop_metadata.csv - codes that match up workshop names with codes used in eventbrite.  Not needed for newer libcal, but needed for backwards compatibility with the qualtrics and eventbrite data.
