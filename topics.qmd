For aggregate workshop metrics, please read Attendance (@sec-attendance), Marketing (@sec-marketing) or Feedback (@sec-satisfaction).  For an overall description of how many topics and frequencies of offerings, see Offerings (@sec-offerings).

## Data sources

We use only scheduled workshops (i.e., not in a course, not on request outside of a course) in these analyses as it has a statistically significant impact on attendance (@sec-attendance). We include only workshops with more than four sessions (two years).
