# Topics {#sec-topics}

For aggregate workshop metrics, please read Attendance (@sec-attendance) or Marketing (@sec-marketing).  For an overall description of how many topics and frequencies of offerings, see Offerings (@sec-offerings).

## Data sources

For attendance data per workshp, we use only scheduled workshops (i.e., not in a course, not on request outside of a course) in these analyses as it has a statistically significant impact on attendance (@sec-attendance). We include only workshops with more than four sessions (two years).

For satisfaction, we include workshops in courses as well as scheduled.
